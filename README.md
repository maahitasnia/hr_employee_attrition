# HR Employee Attrition Analysis and Dashboard

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of employee attrition using a structured HR dataset and an interactive Power BI dashboard. The objective is to identify and visualize the key factors that contribute to employee turnover and assist HR departments in making data-driven decisions.

## Project Description

The analysis is based on a publicly available HR dataset containing information about 1,470 employees. The dataset includes various attributes such as age, gender, department, job role, education level, years at company, job satisfaction, and whether the employee left the company (attrition).

A Power BI dashboard has been developed to provide visual insights into the attrition trends and correlations between different employee attributes and turnover.
